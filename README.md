# Must (To) Do Today React App

A Simple to do react app to add and check off things to do for the day.

React handles the state changes of the app. Being a front-end app it uses local storage to save the items.

Additional features are still being added so the app is not yet in final form.

## Installation ##

The single page Front End -application uses react so you do need to install it with node. 

To install the dependencies go to the project location and type

	npm install
	npm run start

## Use ##

Press Enter to create a new item
Check off current item by checking off the box, which moves the completed task as the final item
Move between items with tab or clicking with mouse

The app uses local storage so it will remember your items from session to session with the same browser. Remember that clearing local storage will permanently delete all the items.
